Working with Git
-------------

Don't know what all this "git" is? No worries, you're in good hands. Take a free journey to [code school](http://try.github.io/)!

Working with Unity
-------------

Open the "The Drop Zone" directory as the project in Unity (not the root dropzone repo). Note the gitignore ignores a lot of files normally visible in a project; this is expected.

Building
-------------

Builds should not be managed under version control. Exporting to the "Builds" directory will satisfy this.
